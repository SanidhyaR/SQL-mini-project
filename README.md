Introduction:
 Libraries around the world are known as temple of knowledge, where people from different backgrounds, ages, and occupations come and gain knowledge from various
 books of different kinds. However, there are many public and school libraries in India which still use physical methods to upkeep the record of the book.
 This often leads to misplacement/loss of many books. Moreover, there is always a high chance of records getting destroyed, damaged, or tampered with.
 The work of managing the record of books itself is very time consuming and exhausting. Thus, there is a need to digitalize the library management to avoid these problems.   
We need software to upkeep and manage the records of these institutions.
A library management system is software that helps in the management of libraries by performing various tasks like keeping the record of borrowed books, calculating
the late submission charges, helping in keeping the record of the books that are required in near future. The system reduces the labor and time of the person in 
charge. The adding of the new books, as well as to see the availability of the books becomes much easier.
A library management system is generally is made up of a relational database, two graphical user interfaces, and software to perform the tasks/actions. 
Generally, library management systems contain various software functions, which they diversify into separate into different programs called modules, 
each containing its own user interface. The books are each given a unique id and are stored into the database with some of their attributes like name, genera, etc.
the staffs are given access to various additional functions which the ordinary users donâ€™t like user details, ordered books, etc. the users, having their details
stored into the database, are assigned/given a unique id, are able to access into the system and are able to do certain tasks like issuing/returning the books.
The staff can access and look into the system to find if the user is eligible to pay a fine or not. The records of the library are thus safe and well managed.

The software is able to run on any operating system, provided it has java support, 
Java swing, MySQL, and JDBC driver are the softwares used to create this project.
